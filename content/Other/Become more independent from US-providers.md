Last week there were news that [Microsoft blocked the account of the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC)](https://www.heise.de/news/Strafgerichtshof-Microsofts-E-Mail-Sperre-als-Weckruf-fuer-digitale-Souveraenitaet-10387368.html). The ICC is sanctioned by US-president Donald Trump.

As the US is becoming a authoritarian regime very fast, it's a good idea to become more and more independent of their technologies. Especially for communication services. As a first step, I decided to move my private email from Google to [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/de/mail), located in Switzerland. It was very easy as I'm using my own domain for a couple of years already. Proton even offers to copy all your emails from Google to their services which worked very well. After 2 days all my mails were migrated.

Besides the fact that Proton is operating from Switzerland, another great thing about it is that all emails are fully encrypted on their servers. 

I'm fully aware that Github is owned by Micrsoft as well. I haven't heard of censorship or account blocking for political reasons but I wouldn't be surprised.
