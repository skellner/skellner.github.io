# Hosting a telescope at a dark site
After doing 1,5 years of astrophotography from my backyard I wanted to up the game. I got some nice results from my backyard in Berlin, but the possibilities are limited due to weather and light pollution. I only managed to drive to a dark site near Berlin for a couple of times on clear nights, so not much improvement there.\
I decided to host a scope at [Trevinca Skies](https://trevincaskies.com/) in Spain instead.\
The monthly rate is ok and the location seems nice.
# Scope
So, what scope to put there? In the first place I contemplated setting up my Celestron EdgeHD 800 at the remote site but after a couple of tests I decided against it:
* Collimation: the scope loses collimation every once in a while due to focusing or changing direction (mirror shift). The solution would have been to add an external focuser. Due to the short back focus of 105mm there is only one pricey solution: [PLL Esatto 2" LP](https://www.primalucelab.com/focusers/esatto-2-lp/).\
  I image in mono, so I need the focuser, a filter wheel and an OAG in the back focus as well
* Star shapes: stars always look a bit blotched with the EdgeHD
* Rotator: I need a rotator to control the framing. With the external focuser there is not enough back focus to add a rotator
* I'm leaning to wide field astrophotography right now

After some consideration, I decided against the EdgeHD for the remote rig. A refractor makes more sense: Refractors do not require collimation and therefore are easy to maintain. I do not need an extra focuser and an OAG in the image train. I get sharp stars and a wide field.
As the Sky Watcher Esprit scopes have a very good reputation in the price range I decided to go for an Esprit 120ED. Luckily there was a promo running and I got one for a very good price from [Teleskop Spezialisten](https://www.teleskop-spezialisten.de/shop/).\
I had to wait for the Skywatcher 0.77 reducer for a couple of weeks. It seems that Skywatcher sold a lot of scopes during the promo while not having enough reducers available.
## Flattener
While waiting for the reducer, I got a flattener from the UK and made some photos with the native FL of 840mm in the meantime, e.g.: [Bode's Galaxy and Cigar](https://app.astrobin.com/u/skellner?i=1erthj#gallery).
So far I'm very happy with the setup. Almost no tilt, nice stars, very sharp. However, the is one caveat: on low temperatures (< 5°C), the stars tend to become hexagonal due to pinched optics.
I learned that is common with these scopes There is a solution: heating. I solved the problem by placing a dew strip directly on the lens cell inside the dew shield. Great star down to -5°C.
## Reducer
Two weeks ago, the reducer arrived and I tested it out with different back focus settings. I got the best results using the same back focus as with the flattener, 58mm. Anything longer didn't work well and I couldn't go shorter with my current adapters. I ordered some additional adapters now to be able to adjust the back focus for 55mm, 56mm, 57mm, and 58mm. I will try out all settings with both the flattener and the reducer to find the best fit.
## Determine Back Focus
I took a structured approach to [[Determine proper back focus for Sky Watcher Esprit 120ED with 0.77 Flattener]].
# Mount
For the mount I went for a [iOptron CEM70](https://www.ioptron.com/product-p/c70a.htm). I generally like the iOptron mounts and I wanted a mount that can serve long focal lengths a.k.a a traditional mount that will guide with long guiding exposures. It will fit well with the Esprit and could also carry a bit more in the future. The CEM120 seemed to be overkill at this point.

# Rotator
I couldn't resist the very low price for the [WandererAstro Rotator Mini](https://www.wandererastro.com/en/h-col-126.html) on [ebay](https://www.ebay.de/itm/386583833104). I was a bit sceptical about the quality and was afraid that it would introduce tilt, but the part is rock solid and very slim. Also the software works very well.

# Flat Panel
I got [WandererAstro Flat Panel](https://www.wandererastro.com/en/h-col-154.html) from the same ebay seller, also a really great product.
# Camera
The Esprit 120ED works well with an APS-C camera, so I will use my Touptek IMX571  mono and get a new camera for my mobile rig if needed.
# Filter &amp; Filter wheel
I will stick with my 36mm Astronomik Deep Sky and 6nm SHO filters and the ZWO 7x36mm EFW.

# Computer &amp; Software
I'm using a [Mele Quieter 3C](https://store.mele.cn/products/mele-quieter-3c-fanless-mini-pc-n5105-small-computer-portable-ddr4-windows11-hdmi-4k-wi-fi-6-gigabit-ethernet-bt-5-2-usb-3-2-3-type-c-dp-sd-card-ssd-support-vesa-mount) with [N.I.N.A](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) for more than a year now and I'm very happy with it. So the remote rig will also run that way.

# Putting it together
I got a [losmandy rail](https://www.ebay.de/itm/387330560596?var=654589079236) from ebay to put on top of the scope and then 3d-printed some [custom brackets](https://www.printables.com/model/1221142-mount-mele-quieter-3c-to-primalucelab-losmandy-pla) to attach the Pegasus Astro [USB Control Hub](https://pegasusastro.com/products/usb-control-hub/) and the [Power Box Micro](https://pegasusastro.com/products/pocket-powerbox-micro/) to the rail. This is a nice and clean solution. The computer will not be attached to the scope, I will put it below the scope.

# Testing
To make sure that the rig will work nicely in Spain I tested it for a couple of nights in my backyard.
