Once I saw the [photo of this amazing design of Borghesani](https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/storage-case-pieces/dry-bars/spectacular-mobile-bar-designed-borghesani/id-f_1240042/#zoomModalOpen) on the web I decided to build my own.

I measured it out from the photos, created a model in Fusion360, and got some american walnut:

This is the shoulder. To save on walnut and make it less prone to bending, I decided to make a construction of multiplex.

For the small drawer I made use of the [shaper origin](https://www.shapertools.com/de-de/origin) to create unusual joints:

I used the shaper also for the "skirt":

And for the inlays made of hard maple:

This is the neck of the bot:
