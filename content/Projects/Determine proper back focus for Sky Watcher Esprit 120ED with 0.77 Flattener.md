# Setup
I took a structured approach to determine the back focus of my Esprit 120ED with the 0.77 reducer. I created a sheet with possible options and made test exposures to assess the results. For each backfocus length I ran the auto focus in the Abberation Inspector in [N.I.N.A](https://nighttime-imaging.eu/) and made a screenshot. Also, I made 3 60s exposures for further analysis in Pixinsight and [ASTAP](https://www.hnsky.org/astap.htm).

58mm is the best. As I also have excellent results with 58mm and the flattener, I will leave it there to make it easy to swap the flattener for the reducer during galaxy season.

Some more image analysis on a single green sub from [Pixinisght](https://pixinsight.com/):

This is quite OK, although not perfect. Last week I tried with 59mm and 60mm but forgot to make screenshots. It didn't improve any further with a longer back focus. I guess this is the best I can get out of this setup. Aberrations like this are easily dealt with in processing to achieve perfectly round stars to the edges.
