There are lots of options for 12V PSUs and it's hard to decide which one to buy. Many people fear that bad quality PSUs could damage their expensive equipment and buy dedicated astrophoto PSUs. I got a PSU from Baader a while ago and needed two more PSUs for my setup. I picked cheap Mean Well units from Amazon which are always a good choice. Today they arrived and I found out the following:

* Baader PSU, 68 EUR vs MeanWell PSU, 15 EUR

Although they look almoste the same, the units are different:

* Baader: Mean Well GSM60B12-P1JSC, [Medical Adaptor](https://www.meanwell-web.com/en-gb/ac-dc-medical-desktop-adaptor-output-12vdc-at-5-0a-gsm60b12--p1j)
* Amazon: Mean Well GSTA60A12-P1J, [Industrial Adaptor](https://www.meanwell-web.com/en-gb/ac-dc-industrial-desktop-adaptor-output-12vdc-at-gst60a12--p1j)

The main difference seems to be the the protection class for medical equipment [EN60601 2xMOPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60601), aka the protection of people using the equipment. So the device is more save to use. There is no indication that it's also more save for your other equipment. 

The price difference on the Mean Well website is about 25%, the difference between the Baader and the cheaper version from Amazon was more than 400%.
