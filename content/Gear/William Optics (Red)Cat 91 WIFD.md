This was released from [Williams Optics](https://williamoptics.com/products/cat-91-wifd) beginning of 2025 and I got a very good copy of the scope, signed by William Yang personally. The stars a pinpoint throughout the whole field (APS-C sensor), the WIFD focuser doesn't introduce any tilt whatsoever and the because of the petzval design there is no need for back focus adjustments. It simply the best scope I had so far. 

Here are [some images I've taken with this scope](https://app.astrobin.com/u/skellner?folder-type=gear&active=NT58708#smart-folders). For this one, I added a couple of raw frames for you to check out: https://app.astrobin.com/u/skellner?i=ohyfs5#gallery
