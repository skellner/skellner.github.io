I bought this [guide scope](https://www.touptekastro.com/en-eu/products/guide-scope) for my [[Remote Telescope Hosting in Spain]]. It looked promising at first because of the focuser.\
The plan was to build a small motorized focuser in order to focus the guide scope remotely as well. However, the "AC" version has a [Crayford Focuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayford_focuser) that can slip.

I adjusted my scope using the four screws on the bottom and it seemed to work well, no slippage. However, at low temperatures the focuser starts slipping again. The colder, the worse.\
I had it out on a cold night (below zero C) and couldn't even focus anymore manually.

The focuser has a M42x0.75 thread so I attached a [ZWO Helical Focuser](https://www.zwoastro.com/product/zwo-1-25%E2%80%B3-helical-focuser/) that I had laying around\
and printed a motor focus based on [this OAG focuser project](https://github.com/jlecomte/ascom-oag-focuser). So this is the solution right now, a guide scope with two focusers:

A nice idea actually: when the motorized focuser fails it can be still focused manually.
