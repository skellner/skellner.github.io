My small power washer leaked after winter. I figured out that it was leaking because a small pipe burst during winter. I left some water in it and the expanding ice burst the pipe.\
I first tried to glue it, but there is a lot of pressure, obviously. Then I searched for the part number and found a [replacement part on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DRMT8PP4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title).\
I guess it's not the original part but it works well. Easy fix.
