This is my beloved [Rocket Appartamento](https://rocket-espresso.com/products/domestic-models/appartamento):

After 7 years it started to loose pressure and temperature every once in a while. I had it at a local repair shop twice(!) and they didn't fix it. So I went for it. I found plans of the machine online and figured out that it could be the pressostat.

I ordered a [matching pressostat](https://www.kaffeetechnik-shop.de/ECM-DruckwaechterXP110-C19900299) for 16.50 € online and put it in. And Voilá, the machine worked again.
